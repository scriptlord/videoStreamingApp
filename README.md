# Challenge
As you know,, most of the social and work life moved online; that sparked an evolution in video sharing services like Zoom, Google Meet, and many others. 

This project is to have hands-on experience on using technologies like e.g. WebRTC, how to build an app that allows one to video chat with friends and colleagues just as well as Zoom does.
